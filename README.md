# My Personal Project


## Grades Recorder


The application solves following *problems*:
- **What will the application do?**
This application can be used to **store** the marks of quizzes,assignments, midterms and finals results of all the subject
in a term of a university student. It can calculate *average* score/percent and compare it with pre entered *expected*
score as well as *predict* the amount of marks a student needs to obtain to meet the desired score.

- **Who will use it?**
*University **students*** as well as *school **students*** can use it to keep a track of their grade record.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
This project is very important to me as being a *university student* myself, I did all of these tasks defined above
**manually** and had to rely on a sheet of paper. **Automating** these would save time and give me accurate results without
the hassle of storing all of this information in my memory.
